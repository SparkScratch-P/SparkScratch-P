<details><summary><b>Click to EXPAND</b></summary>

I am Prodyumna Pal, a software (FOSS) developer and electronic systems enthusiast, who patronizes modern and futuristic technologies and aims to increase the interaction between Computers and the real world. I got hooked up in the world of Programming and Development, since my ninth standard, when the lockdown stuck school-going students to computer screens. In 2024, I passed my class 12th under AISSCE (CBSE) from Delhi Public School,(Joka) South Kolkata as the Head Boy of the institution. I have been building software under my own brand stamp, SPARK Technosapiens for 3 years now.

 I began with Scratch, a beginner-level block-based language, but, over time, my algorithm skills evolved, and so did Scratch, with its more modifications and extensions. I had done extensive research on how to use it as a professional language and achieve complex processes of high accuracy and quality using this language, and finally, I made Windows Applications, Websites, web applications, and even higher-level projects including IoT Controls and Augmented Virtual Reality software. I also had a similar journey of discovering the potential of motion detection algorithms with Scratch and IoT sensors.  I am skilled in Web-Application Development using Extensive Scratch JS, and IoT (Arduino, ESP) Development using Embedded C language and further trying to integrate the two.

  I have a research paper, titled "Prolonged Suspicious Inactivity Monitoring of Old Aged People", published by a high-impact journal, the International Journal of Scientific Research in Engineering and Management (IJSREM), and another, titled, "Event Identification with Motion Detection", in the International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR). I have been awarded the Certificate of Merit from the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum, Govt of India during my participation in the Annual Science Fair on Sustainable Development. I have remained an A+ Lvl developer in GitHub during 2020-23. My ongoing research works include Event-Identification: Potentials of Applied Motion Detection Technology with corresponding Augmented Virtual Reality and Telemetry: Connecting UEV (Electronic UAV & UGV) beyond the radio-transmission range.
